## 💡 What Is EBS?

Imagine this:

- 💻 You have a **laptop** → that’s your **EC2 instance**
- 🔌 You plug in an **external hard drive via USB** → that’s your **EBS volume**
- 📴 If you shut down your laptop, the external drive still keeps your data

That’s exactly how **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** works in AWS.

## 📦 Real World vs AWS Storage

| Feature        | Real External SSD                         | AWS EBS Volume                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 📏 Fixed Size   | You buy a 1TB SSD, that’s all you get      | Start with 10GB, grow to 1TB+           |
| 🔄 Scaling      | Buy a new SSD for more space               | Resize live—no hardware swap            |
| ⏱️ Downtime     | Manual data copy to new SSD                | Resize without stopping EC2             |
| 💰 Cost         | Pay upfront for full SSD                   | Pay only for what you use               |

---

## 🔧 AWS EBS Features

- Resize volumes anytime
- Change volume types (e.g., from slower to faster SSD)
- Create snapshots and restore them to bigger volumes

---

## 📸 Snapshots

**Snapshots** are backups of EBS volumes.  
They are stored in **Amazon S3** and can be used to **restore** or **create new volumes**.

## 🧩 Running Databases: EC2 vs RDS

### 🔧 Option 1: EC2 + EBS (Manual Setup)

You install and manage the database yourself.

- 🖥️ EC2 = Virtual server
- 💽 EBS = Attached storage
- 🛠️ Install MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- 🔄 You handle backups, scaling, updates

✅ Full control  
❌ More work, more responsibility

---

### 🤖 Option 2: RDS (Managed Setup)

AWS handles everything behind the scenes.

- 🧠 Choose your DB engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- 🚀 AWS launches EC2 + EBS for you
- 🔗 You connect to the DB endpoint

✅ Easy to use  
❌ Less control over the system

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Component | Role                                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| EC2       | Virtual server (runs the database)        |
| EBS       | Storage for EC2 (holds DB files)          |
| RDS       | Managed DB service (uses EC2 + EBS inside)|

---

## ❓ When to Use EC2 + EBS

Use this setup if:
- You need a **custom DB** (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
- You want **full OS-level control**
- You're running a **non-relational** or **experimental** DB

Otherwise, prefer **RDS** for simplicity and reliability.

---

## 🔍 Why Use EBS for Databases?

Use **EBS** when:
- You want to install MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB yourself
- You need custom configurations or special software
- You want full control over the server and database

Use **RDS** when:
- You want AWS to manage everything
- You need automatic backups, scaling, failover
- You don’t want to worry about OS or patching

---

## 🧁 Analogy Time

- 🍳 **EBS + EC2** = Cooking from scratch in your own kitchen  
- 🍱 **RDS** = Ordering from a restaurant that cooks and delivers for you

> RDS is great for relational databases—but behind the scenes, it still uses EBS volumes. AWS just manages it for you.

## 🔍 EBS vs RDS Comparison

| Feature         | EBS + EC2 (Self-Managed DB)         | RDS (Managed DB Service)               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🛠️ Setup        | You install and manage the database  | AWS sets it up for you                 |
| ⚙️ Control       | Full control over OS, DB configs     | Limited control, easier to manage      |
| 🔧 Maintenance   | You handle backups, updates          | AWS automates backups, patching        |
| 📦 Storage       | Uses EBS volumes                     | Uses EBS under the hood (managed)      |
| 💰 Cost          | Can be cheaper, but more work        | Slightly more expensive, less effort   |
| 🧪 Use Case      | Custom setups, full control needed   | Quick deployment, less admin overhead  |

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

- **EBS** = Block storage for EC2 (like a hard drive)
- **EC2** = Virtual server (you manage everything)
- **RDS** = Managed database service (uses EC2 + EBS internally)
- Use **EBS + EC2** for full control  
- Use **RDS** for simplicity and automation

### But what about when we run mongodb deployment on k8s . we dont use ebs right?


## 🧵 MongoDB + EBS + Kubernetes — The Core Idea

> **Ever wondered how MongoDB stores data in the cloud when running on Kubernetes?**  
> If you're thinking "Do we still need EBS like we do with EC2?" — you're asking the right question.

### 📦 MongoDB Needs Persistent Storage

- On AWS, the go-to option for persistent storage is **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**.

### 🖥️ MongoDB on EC2

- You **manually attach and manage EBS volumes**.
- You install MongoDB yourself and configure everything from scratch.

### ☸️ MongoDB on Kubernetes

- You **don’t manage EBS directly**.
- Instead, you define a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**.
- Kubernetes uses the PVC to **automatically provision EBS** behind the scenes.

### ✅ Bottom Line

- **MongoDB still uses EBS** in both EC2 and Kubernetes setups.
- But with Kubernetes, the **complexity is abstracted** — making deployment and scaling much easier.



### 🛠 Example in Kubernetes:
You might define a `StorageClass` that uses AWS EBS, then create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` like this:



```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongodb-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: gp2  # This maps to AWS EBS

```

## EBS VS S3

- EBS is like a hard drive for your EC2 instance—great for running software, databases, and OS-level tasks.
- S3 is like a cloud-based file cabinet—perfect for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content.
