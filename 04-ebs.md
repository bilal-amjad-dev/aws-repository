### 🔍 So Why Use EBS for Databases?
You use **EBS** when:

You want to install **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**, etc. yourself

You need **custom configurations** or special software

You want **full control** over the server and database

You use **RDS** when:

You want AWS to **manage everything**

You need **automatic backups, scaling, failover**

You don’t want to worry about OS or patching



### 🧁 Analogy Time
- **EBS + EC2** = Cooking from scratch in your own kitchen

- **RDS** = Ordering from a restaurant that cooks and delivers for you

So yes, RDS is great for relational databases—but behind the scenes, **RDS still uses EBS volumes** to store your data. AWS just manages it for you.



### 🧠 EBS vs RDS – What’s the Difference?
| Feature	| EBS + EC2 (Self-Managed DB)	| RDS (Managed DB Service) |
|---|---|---|
| 🛠️ Setup	| You install and manage the database	| AWS sets it up for you |
| ⚙️ Control	| Full control over OS, DB configs	|Limited control, but easier to manage | 
| 🔧 Maintenance	| You handle backups, updates, etc.	| AWS automates backups, patching | 
| 📦 Storage	| Uses EBS volumes	| Uses EBS under the hood (managed) | 
| 💰 Cost	| Can be cheaper, but more work	| Slightly more expensive, less effort |
|🧪 Use Case	| Custom setups, full control needed	| Quick deployment, less admin overhead |
