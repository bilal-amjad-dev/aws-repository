### 🧠 EBS vs RDS – What’s the Difference?
| **Feature	| EBS + EC2 (Self-Managed DB)	| RDS (Managed DB Service)** |
|---|---|---|
| 🛠️ Setup	| You install and manage the database	| AWS sets it up for you |
| ⚙️ Control	| Full control over OS, DB configs	|Limited control, but easier to manage | 
| 🔧 Maintenance	| You handle backups, updates, etc.	| AWS automates backups, patching | 
| 📦 Storage	| Uses EBS volumes	| Uses EBS under the hood (managed) | 
| 💰 Cost	| Can be cheaper, but more work	| Slightly more expensive, less effort |
|🧪 Use Case	| Custom setups, full control needed	| Quick deployment, less admin overhead |
