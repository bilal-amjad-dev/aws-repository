## 💡 What Is EBS?

Imagine this:

- 💻 You have a **laptop** → that’s your **EC2 instance**
- 🔌 You plug in an **external hard drive via USB** → that’s your **EBS volume**
- 📴 If you shut down your laptop, the external drive still keeps your data

That’s exactly how **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** works in AWS.

## 📦 Real World vs AWS Storage

| Feature        | Real External SSD                         | AWS EBS Volume                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 📏 Fixed Size   | You buy a 1TB SSD, that’s all you get      | Start with 10GB, grow to 1TB+           |
| 🔄 Scaling      | Buy a new SSD for more space               | Resize live—no hardware swap            |
| ⏱️ Downtime     | Manual data copy to new SSD                | Resize without stopping EC2             |
| 💰 Cost         | Pay upfront for full SSD                   | Pay only for what you use               |

## 🔧 AWS EBS Features

- Resize volumes anytime
- Change volume types (e.g., from slower to faster SSD)
- Create snapshots and restore them to bigger volumes

---

## 📸 Snapshots

**Snapshots** are backups of EBS volumes.  
They are stored in **Amazon S3** and can be used to **restore** or **create new volumes**.

## 🧩 Running Databases: EC2 vs RDS

### 🔧 Option 1: EC2 + EBS (Manual Setup)

You install and manage the database yourself.

- 🖥️ EC2 = Virtual server
- 💽 EBS = Attached storage
- 🛠️ Install MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- 🔄 You handle backups, scaling, updates

✅ Full control  
❌ More work, more responsibility

---

### 🤖 Option 2: RDS (Managed Setup)

AWS handles everything behind the scenes.

- 🧠 Choose your DB engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- 🚀 AWS launches EC2 + EBS for you
- 🔗 You connect to the DB endpoint

✅ Easy to use  
❌ Less control over the system

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Component | Role                                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| EC2       | Virtual server (runs the database)        |
| EBS       | Storage for EC2 (holds DB files)          |
| RDS       | Managed DB service (uses EC2 + EBS inside)|

---

## ❓ When to Use EC2 + EBS

Use this setup if:
- You need a **custom DB** (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
- You want **full OS-level control**
- You're running a **non-relational** or **experimental** DB

Otherwise, prefer **RDS** for simplicity and reliability.

---

## 🔍 Why Use EBS for Databases?

Use **EBS** when:
- You want to install MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB yourself
- You need custom configurations or special software
- You want full control over the server and database

Use **RDS** when:
- You want AWS to manage everything
- You need automatic backups, scaling, failover
- You don’t want to worry about OS or patching

---

## 🧁 Analogy Time

- 🍳 **EBS + EC2** = Cooking from scratch in your own kitchen  
- 🍱 **RDS** = Ordering from a restaurant that cooks and delivers for you

> RDS is great for relational databases—but behind the scenes, it still uses EBS volumes. AWS just manages it for you.

## 🔍 EBS vs RDS Comparison

| Feature         | EBS + EC2 (Self-Managed DB)         | RDS (Managed DB Service)               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🛠️ Setup        | You install and manage the database  | AWS sets it up for you                 |
| ⚙️ Control       | Full control over OS, DB configs     | Limited control, easier to manage      |
| 🔧 Maintenance   | You handle backups, updates          | AWS automates backups, patching        |
| 📦 Storage       | Uses EBS volumes                     | Uses EBS under the hood (managed)      |
| 💰 Cost          | Can be cheaper, but more work        | Slightly more expensive, less effort   |
| 🧪 Use Case      | Custom setups, full control needed   | Quick deployment, less admin overhead  |

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

- **EBS** = Block storage for EC2 (like a hard drive)
- **EC2** = Virtual server (you manage everything)
- **RDS** = Managed database service (uses EC2 + EBS internally)
- Use **EBS + EC2** for full control  
- Use **RDS** for simplicity and automation

### 🤔 But what about when we run mongodb deployment on k8s . we dont use ebs right?


## 🧵 MongoDB + EBS + Kubernetes — The Core Idea

> **Ever wondered how MongoDB stores data in the cloud when running on Kubernetes?**  
> If you're thinking "Do we still need EBS like we do with EC2?" — you're asking the right question.

### 📦 MongoDB Needs Persistent Storage

- On AWS, the go-to option for persistent storage is **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**.

### 🖥️ MongoDB on EC2

- You **manually attach and manage EBS volumes**.
- You install MongoDB yourself and configure everything from scratch.

### ☸️ MongoDB on Kubernetes

- You **don’t manage EBS directly**.
- Instead, you define a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**.
- Kubernetes uses the PVC to **automatically provision EBS** behind the scenes.

### ✅ Bottom Line

- **MongoDB still uses EBS** in both EC2 and Kubernetes setups.
- But with Kubernetes, the **complexity is abstracted** — making deployment and scaling much easier.



### 🛠 Example in Kubernetes:
You might define a `StorageClass` that uses AWS EBS, then create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` like this:



```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongodb-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: gp2  # This maps to AWS EBS

```

I've discovered a helpful trick to understand EBS more deeply.

In GCP, the equivalent service to AWS's EBS is called Persistent Disk.

When an EC2 instance is terminated, the data on its attached EBS volume is not automatically deleted. The EBS volume and its data persist independently. This is a key feature of EBS, but it's important to note that the default behavior for the root volume of an EC2 instance is often to be deleted upon termination, so you must explicitly change that setting if you want to keep the root volume's data.

Similarly, in Kubernetes, when you use a Persistent Volume (PV) that is backed by an EBS volume and your pod is deleted, the data on the EBS volume does not get deleted. This is because the PV and the EBS volume have their own, separate lifecycle from the pod.

A new pod can be created later and can use the same Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to access the existing data, which is exactly why this type of storage is called "persistent."

## EBS VS S3

- EBS is like a hard drive for your EC2 instance—great for running software, databases, and OS-level tasks.
- S3 is like a cloud-based file cabinet—perfect for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content.
